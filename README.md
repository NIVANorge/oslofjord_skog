# Osloskog: Modelling the effects of forest harvesting on nutrient fluxes to the Oslofjord

Project for Landbruksdirektoratet in collaboration with NIBIO.

## Workflow

 * **[Merge SR16beta]()**. Combining the raster tiles for NIBIO's SR16beta dataset into a single vector layer.

 * **[1000 Lakes logging]()**. Screening for human activities (including harvesting) within the "1000 Lakes" catchments.

 * **[Harvesting coefficients]()**. Exploring options to represent the effects of harvesting on background runoff concentrations.

 * **[Modelling the effects of harvesting]()**. Using TEOTIL3 to model additional nutrient fluxes due to harvesting.
